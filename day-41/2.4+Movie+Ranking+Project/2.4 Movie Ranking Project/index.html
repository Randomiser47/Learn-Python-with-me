<h3>Atomic Habits</h3>
<p>I really love how the author tells us to build habits</p>
<h3>Can't hurt me (by David Goggins)</h3>
<p>Goggins shares his pains and hard situations for the reader
    to understand that he wasn't different than all of us rather he
    is like us </p>
<h3>Never finished: unchsackle your mind and win the war</h3>
<p>More reflective and raw than can't hurt me. A good follow up must read</p>
