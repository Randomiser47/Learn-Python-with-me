# Console Errors and the Red lines
## Red Underlines
All the code editors have this feature (hopefully), when you write a code and do something wrong it underlines the code in **RED**. when you will run this code it will give and error. i.e.,
```python
if 3 > 2:
print("wow")
```
The above piece of code will show up with a red bar under your print statement because it is not properly indented. The code editor will warn you ahead of time before executing that something is wrong with the code here(the red underlined place). This can help us find and eliminate errors **Before Executing** It is to be noted that it will also throw an error when you try to execute this piece of code. Which takes us to the other topic.

## Console Errors
The errors that show up in console **After Executing** a program.
let us take the same example code:
```python
if 3 > 2:
print("wow")
```
The above code when run will throw such an error in our console.
```
 File "test.py", line 2
    print("wow")
    ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 1
```
I would recommend copy and pasting the error message into **Google** and reading on it. 
One of the sites that will show up is **stack overflow** Please post their problems and you can find your problem listed there with a bunch of solutions. 

**What I don't recommend is using AI tools to solve your problem for you, you won't learn shit if you do that**
