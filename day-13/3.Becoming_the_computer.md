# 3. Become the Computer 

Instead of runing the code at every change, sit there calmly and look at the code try to understand what it was made to do and what it is doing.

**Exercise**
```python
year = 1994 
if year > 1980 and year < 1994: 
print("You are a millennial.") 
elif year > 1994: 
print("You are a Gen Z.")
```

The code has a bug. Try to find out what it is without using a computer. 

* hint: the print statements will not work.
